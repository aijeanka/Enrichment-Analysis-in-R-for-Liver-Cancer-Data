# Enrichment Analysis in R for Liver Cancer Data

## Project Overview
This project involves conducting an Enrichment Analysis using the R package EnrichR to compare gene expression data between patients with Edmonson Grade II and Edmonson Grade III liver cancer. The analysis aims to identify significant pathways that could explain the progression from one cancer grade to another.

## Data Description
The input data includes T-test results from a gene expression group comparison, filtered based on p-values (<= 0.01) and fold changes (greater than 1.5 or less than -1.5).

## Files
- `Aizhan_Uteubayeva_EnrichR_HW.Rmd` - R Markdown file detailing the filtering and analysis process.
- `Aizhan_Uteubayeva_EnrichR.pdf` - PDF report of the R Markdown file, providing a comprehensive overview of the analysis.
- `Aizhan_Uteubayeva_EnrichR_HW.xlsx` - Excel file containing the Enrichment Analysis results with tabs for each analyzed online database.

## Analysis Highlights
- Pathways of interest based on the analysis include Ferroptosis, Vascular smooth muscle contraction, and Regulation of actin cytoskeleton.

## How to Run
- The R Markdown file (`Aizhan_Uteubayeva_EnrichR_HW.Rmd`) contains all necessary code and instructions to reproduce the analysis.
